//! Shared test helpers: resolve the cross-implementation fixture trees by path.
//!
//! These fixtures are the canonical cross-implementation conformance vectors,
//! vendored under `tests/fixtures/` so this crate verifies byte-parity entirely
//! on its own. They are byte-identical to the vectors the TypeScript and Python
//! SDKs load, so passing them proves cross-implementation agreement.
//!
//! This is a shared support module included by multiple integration-test
//! binaries. Each binary uses only the subset of helpers it needs, so the
//! unused-on-this-build helpers are expected; the allow keeps the shared API
//! whole without per-binary noise.
