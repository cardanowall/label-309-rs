//! The resumable / chunked upload helper.
//!
//! [`upload_resumable`] is the additive, threshold-gated counterpart to the
//! single-shot [`uploads`](crate::client::PoeNamespace::uploads). It exists for
//! one reason: a single request body is commonly capped at ~100 MB by a CDN or
//! reverse proxy, so a file larger than that cannot ride the single-shot
//! multipart `POST`. The helper splits a large file into chunks the gateway
//! reassembles, and resumes a dropped transfer instead of restarting it.
//!
//! Path selection is by size:
//!
//! - A source at or below the threshold (default
//!   [`DEFAULT_RESUMABLE_THRESHOLD_BYTES`]) rides the existing single-shot
//!   `uploads` path unchanged — the resumable helper adds nothing and changes
//!   nothing for small files.
//! - A larger source runs the content-addressed session flow: declare the
//!   whole-file SHA-256 + size up front (which unlocks dedup and affordability
//!   before any bytes flow), `PUT` each chunk under its own integrity digest, then
//!   `complete` to assemble + hand the file into the gateway's normal storage
//!   pipeline.
//!
//! ## Whole-file hashing is streamed
//!
//! The declared digest is computed in one bounded-memory pass over the source so
//! a multi-GB file is never held in memory. A path source is read in fixed-size
//! reads; an in-memory source hashes its slice directly.
//!
//! ## Chunks are sent sequentially
//!
//! The gateway's positional-write protocol permits chunks to arrive out of order
//! and in parallel, and a browser is expected to run a few parallel `PUT`s to
//! saturate its uplink. This SDK is deliberately blocking and routes every
//! request through one shared, non-`Send`/`Sync` egress (the same single
//! outbound path the verifier uses, so the deny-host / SSRF / protocol guards
//! apply uniformly). Spawning chunk uploads across threads would force a
//! `Send + Sync` bound onto the transport trait, a breaking change rippling
//! through every namespace and the test stubs, for a throughput win the blocking
//! posture does not target. So chunks are sent **one at a time**, each retried on
//! a transient failure. The resilience the protocol promises — never re-sending a
//! received chunk, resuming a dropped transfer from the `missing` set — is fully
//! preserved; only the within-session parallelism is dropped, which a caller that
//! needs it can recover by driving the wire protocol directly.
