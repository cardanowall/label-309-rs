//! Sealed-PoE wire-shape and input-validation error taxonomy.
//!
//! These are the typed failures the wrap, unwrap, trial-decrypt, and
//! passphrase seal/open paths raise *before* (and around) the cryptographic
//! core: a bad recipient-key length, an unsupported algorithm identifier, a
//! slot field that is the wrong size. They map one-to-one onto the
//! `EciesSealedPoeError` codes the TypeScript and Python SDKs raise, so
//! cross-implementation tests can assert the exact same `code` string. Codes
//! that name a condition the wire-format registry also names reuse the
//! registry string verbatim; conditions with no wire counterpart (RNG
//! failures, raw input length errors) carry construction-only names.
//!
//! A failed *decryption* (wrong recipient key, a tampered MAC, a tampered
//! ciphertext, a wrong passphrase) is NOT an error here — it is a structured
//! non-match returned by the unwrap / open path, never an exception. The codes
//! below are reserved for malformed input and unsupported-algorithm conditions
//! the caller can fix.
